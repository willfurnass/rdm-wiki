## Definition of Research Data (RD) ##

*Recorded factual material commonly retained by and accepted in the scientific community to validate research findings.*

## EPSRC Policy Framework on Research Data ##

 * Implemented from 1 May 2011
 * Developed with university administrators, adademics and collaborators in industry
 * Sets out **expectations** re management and provision of access to EPSRC-funded RD
 * Institutions are able to develop policies and practises that satisfy these expectations but also suit their needs.


Seven core principles align with core RCUK principles of RD management (RDM):

 * Make RD available widely, freely and in a timely and responsible manner.
 * The research process should not be damaged by the release of RD.  Legal provisions are already in place for accessing publicly funded information: Freedom of Information (FoI act) and the Environmental Information Regulations (EIR).  Information must be supplied to the requestor within 20d unless certain excemptions apply (national security, law enforcement, commercial interests and/or data protection could be impacted).  Jisc have published advice on this (ref)?
 * All users of RD should acknowledge the source and abide by terms and conditions.
 * Researchers should have privileged access to their data for a limited discipline/project-specific duration to allow them to publish results.
 * RDM policies should acknowledge relevant standards and best practise and exist for all data.  Data with acknowledged long-term value should be preseved but remain accessible and usable by future researchers.
 * Metadata should be recorded and made available to aid reuse.  Always link from results to supporting data, ideally using a DOI.
 * Public funds can be used to preserve and manage access to RD.  RD management and access mechanisms should be effective and efficient.

## Benefits of RD(M) ##

1. Increased visibility of research.  Generation of citations.  
1. Reinforcing open scientific inquiry. 
1. Protect against faulty data: allow results to be independently verified.  Could help to resolve disputes.
1. Stimulating new approaches to data collection and methods of analysis 
1. Increasing awareness of research in related areas leading to more opportunities for collaboration 
1. Re-use of data for research not forseen by the original investigators, which offers efficiency savings in terms of money and time
1. Opportunities for combining data from multiple sources
1. Education of new researchers and the public

## Protecting Intellectual Property (IP) ##

EPSRC wants institutions to use the protections afforded by the FoA exceptions to restrict the release of data that might have an adverse impact on common projects and industry collaborations.  Confidentiality agreements and publication plans are acceptable.

## Time scales ##

 * Institutions to align pollicy and practise with EPSRC expectations by 1 May 2012
 * Full compliance required by 1 May 2015

## Responsibility for costs ##

 * Costs relating to systems and infrastructure relating to storage and management of RD can be covered by public funds.  
 * Institutions are expected to cover costs from within received funding, using both direct and indirect streams where appropriate
 * Institutions may wish collaborate on commissioning RDM services from a third party provider
