# Citing data #

 * [[DataCite|http://www.datacite.org]] is an international not-for-profit organisation which aims to improve data citation in order to:
    * establish easier access to research data on the Internet
    * increase acceptance of research data as legitimate, citable contributions to the scholarly record
    * support data archiving that will permit results to be verified and re-purposed for future study.
    Recommends that data be cited using permanent identifiers (DOIs).  Recommends a couple of formats for citing data.
 * [[CASRAI|Bodies-and-policies]] and [[NISO|Bodies-and-policies]] have proposed a new standard taxonomy of 
   [[14 roles relating to research outputs|http://blogs.plos.org/speakingofmedicine/2014/04/23/greater-clarity-recognition-publication-research/]].  
   The idea is that these could be used to augment hte traditional author list and 
   allow a greater variety of contributions to be formally recognised.
