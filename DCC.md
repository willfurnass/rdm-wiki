## Data Asset Framework ##

The [[Data Asset Framework|http://www.dcc.ac.uk/resources/repository-audit-and-assessment/data-asset-framework]] (formerly the Data Audit Framework) provides organisations with the means to identify, locate, describe and assess how they are managing their research data assets.

DAF combines a set of methods with an online tool to enable data auditors to gather this information. DAF will help ensure that research data produced in UK Higher Education Institutions is preserved and remains accessible in the long term.

## Curation Costs Exchange ##

The [[CCEx|www.curationexchange.org]] site is a front-end to a crowd-sourced driven database and library of curation cost information.  CCEx uses the costs data it gathers to provide automatic generation of results for the purposes of self-assessment, cost comparisons with peers and insights into the financial accounting and activity costs of other organisations; supporting the 4C Projectâ€™s vision of creating a better understanding of digital curation costs through collaboration.
