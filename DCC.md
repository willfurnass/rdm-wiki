## Data Asset Framework ##

The [[Data Asset Framework|http://www.dcc.ac.uk/resources/repository-audit-and-assessment/data-asset-framework]] (formerly the Data Audit Framework) provides organisations with the means to identify, locate, describe and assess how they are managing their research data assets.

DAF combines a set of methods with an online tool to enable data auditors to gather this information. DAF will help ensure that research data produced in UK Higher Education Institutions is preserved and remains accessible in the long term.
