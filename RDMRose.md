"Research data management concerns the organisation of data, from its entry to the research cycle through to the dissemination and archiving of valuable results." (Whyte & Tedds, 2011)

"Digital curation, broadly interpreted, is about maintaining and adding value to a trusted body of digital information for current and future use." (DCC 101:6)

Digital Curation Centre lifecycle model
 * Based on the Open Archival Information System reference model for archiving digital info
 * but also includes activities relating to data creation, use and re-use
 * idealised: curation planned for from beginning
