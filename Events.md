In reverse chronological order:

 * [[SciDataCon 2014|http://www.scidatacon2014.org]], the International Conference on Data Sharing and Integration for Global Sustainability, will be structured around four 'tracks': (A) Dynamic Planet, (B) Global Development, (C) Transformations Towards Sustainability, and (D) Data Science and Services.  By focusing on the intersection of data issues and scientific research challenges—and by advancing data science and developing international data services—SciDataCon will also amplify the message of like-minded global data initiatives promoting data sharing and interoperability, such as the Group on Earth Observations (GEO) and the recently established Research Data Alliance (RDA).  2-5 Nov 2014, New Delhi.
