 * Badges: embed impact of research on own site using various metrics.
 * Social networking aspects: follow certain researchers, categories, tags and saved searches on figshare (a la ResearchGate?)
 * Desktop uploaded (drag and drop)
 * Hosted media e.g. images, videos can be viewed online
 * Private research (default free account)

 * Uses altmetrics (impact metrics other than journal impact factor and researcher h-index) e.g.  HTML/PDF views, discussed (Twitter, Wikipedia etc), saved (Mendelay, Zotero etc),  cited (WoS/WoK/Scopus/CrossRef), recommended (e.g. [[F1000Prime]])

## figshare For institutions ##
 * Help institutions learn how much data they are producing, impact etc.
 * push to internal repo for catalogue (ePrints/Symplectic Elements?)
 * Collaborative spaces 

## Questions ##

 * How much per-user storage if have figshare for Institutions?
 * Licenses too permissive?
    * CC-BY - can request share-alike or non-commercial? 
    * CC0 does not require attribution (but does copyright law apply if dataset contains only facts?)
    * MIT for code - can request (L)GPL?
 * Overlap with other services such as ResearchGate, ePrints/Symplectic Elements
 * How do figshare make money?  PloS pay for visualisations and data.  figshare for Insitutions.  Supported by Digital Science.  [[Personal plans|http://figshare.com/pricing]]
